            <p>The Focus
           The year 2022 passed out in a jiffy before I could even realise. Such was the focus on the job at hand. Reading, assimilating, preparing, writing, composing and eventually posting my views on various topics involved both time and dedication. it was interesting and even entertaining at times to pen down words to my hearts content.
           The Progress
           An article every alternate day was the frequency which I achieved this year, though I had a 32 day streak of consecutive articles during the FIFA World Cup too. The Year eventually ended with a total of 225 articles, 43 thousand views and 19 thousand visitors. These statistics are not mind blowing or piercing the roof so to say and still some colossal work is required to be done. But when I consider the day I had started and wrote my first article in the last week of May in 2021, I am amazed at the progress I have made and certainly there is so much for me to be grateful about.
           My Gratitude List
           I am grateful to the Almighty for helping me open my eyes to witness another beautiful day of His creation. For giving me another day to enjoy His bounties.
           For giving me the ability to assimilate and post my views through the several articles I have written. Without HIs divine intervention nothing is possible.</p>
